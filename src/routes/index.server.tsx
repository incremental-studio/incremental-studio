      <p>Ideas I’m chipping away on while my kids are napping:</p>
      <ul>
        {projects.map((project) => (
          <li key={project.handle}>
            <Link to={`/projects/${project.handle}`}>{project.name}</Link>:{" "}
            {project.description}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some of these projects might become proper services, others may never
        see the light of day. The goal is just to build and learn.
