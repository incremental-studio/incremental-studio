      <p>Particular projects in development include:</p>

        Some of these projects have or will become full fledged companies,
        others may never see the light of day. My main goal is to learn by
        doing. I have the full intention of bringing each of these ideas to
        life, but I'm first prioritizing my family, and my day job at&nbsp;

      <p>
        I’m also thinking about writing a blog, where I’d post about the things
        I’m learning and resources I’ve found most helpful. If you think that
        would be interesting, please{' '}

      <p>
        I’m always excited by new ideas, but am already strapped for time. If
        you’re a great developer that cares a lot about craft, I’d be happy to
        talk about collaborating.
